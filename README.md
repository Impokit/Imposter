## 🎲 How to Play

1. create or join **lobby**  
   - 3 - 20 players -> approx. ⅓ of the players are Imposters **(rule of thumb)**

2. **The secret word**  
   - Before the round starts, **every crewmate** gets the same word.  
   - The Imposters see **only a hint** (e.g. “it's an animal”).  

3. **2 rounds of conversation**  
   - In turn, each person says **one** sentence that describes the word without giving it away.  
   - Observe who sounds funny - the Imposters often guess into the blue.  

4. **Vote phase**  
   - Voting takes place after 2 rounds.  
   - Whoever gets the most votes is eliminated.
   - After the vote, everyone sees whether the eliminated player was an Imposter. 

5. **Wining conditions**  
   - **Crew wins** if **all imposters** have been voted out.  
   - **Imposters win** if **at least one imposter** is the last one
